cpp statemachine code gen - which does function per event and then switch on state.

dependencies are not included - but are from old sourceforge project http://sourceforge.net/projects/stateproto/

concerns:

a) generating explicit exit/entry/transition for every guard condition even if two conditions share a code path.
b) python generator code is too complex - might have to rewrite to fit with previous fsm gen samples. Wanted to get to testing cpp code asap.

notes:

a) generated cpp code does not build yet.
b) no state history support yet.
c) used old stateproto C# gui to generate input file: test_machine1.sm1
